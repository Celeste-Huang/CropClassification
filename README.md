# CropClassification

####The task is a supervised and multiclass classification problem. My method to solve this problem includes two steps: data preparation and model training. The Step 1 is to resample the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) image to match with the resolution of the RapidEye satellite image. In addition, this step also involves construction of training and test datasets for model training in Step 2. After Step 1, a file named ‘final.csv’ is generated. The Step 2 is to construct a multi-layer feedforward neural network (FNN) for this task. The outcomes of Step 2 are a labeled image with finer resolution (5m) and the confusion matrix to estimation the classification performance. I will detail the design of these two steps in the following paragraphs.
